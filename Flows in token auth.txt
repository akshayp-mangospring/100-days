Sign Up Flow:
  Provide Sign Up Info.
  Controller checks validations of blank and formats.
  User is created with the Sign Up info provided if the info is valid.
  JWTs(Access Token and Refresh Token) are generated and are sent back to the User, along with User info in it.
  User then stores that JWT on the client side.
  Sends the Tokens received from the server in the Authorization Header in the subsequent requests.
  He is now eligible for log out.
  On Log out the user can remove the tokens stored on the client.

Login Flow:
  Provide the Login Info.
  Controller checks whether the info provided has correct creds like Username and Password
  JWTs(Access Token and Refresh Token) are generated and are sent back to the User, along with User info in it.
  User then stores that JWT on the client side.
  Sends the Tokens received from the server in the Authorization Header in the subsequent requests.
  He is now eligible for log out.
  On Log out the user can remove the tokens stored on the client.

Subsequent Requests after login Flow:
  User sends the Tokens received from the server in the Authorization Header in all the requests if the token is existing.
  Each request is then checked in the Application Controller or Middleware for the existence of a valid token:
  If Valid
    Request is forwarded to the intended controller for further processing
  Else
    Return the request with a 401(Unauthorized) status code
