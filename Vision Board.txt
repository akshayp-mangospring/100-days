The features I'm gonna add to the App are:
Users & Authentication with JWT - Crude Done
Blog with Comments
Replies on the Comments
Blog must be likeable
Comments must be likeable
Replies on Comments must be likeable
Pomodoro Timer
Blogs from any user must be searchable to all users.
Basic text based 1-0-1 Chat amongst multiple users.

The full view of the App must be a Productivity App:
The Motto of the App will be to Write within a set time for stuff which should not require more time.
Stuff such as your daily log shouldn't require time more than 5 mins.
If the timer is up then stuff would be Auto Published.
Max time should be 25 mins for anything.
Write a Blog article within a Pomodoro timer set, on Pomodoro finish
Write a Blog article without a Pomodoro timer
Todos
Daily Logger

In future:
Deletion of a Todo should also give an Undo action, but just for 3 seconds, which will give a final call to deletion API
A Todo should have notes/desc with rich text support, priority, due date
The To Do items in the Todo List must be draggable, the order must be set according to what was set
I'll do the same project later in NodeJS and MongoDB

Technical stuff to do in the near future:
Connect the App to MySQL - Done
Add Redux or Context to the App on the Front End
Dockerize the App for deployment convenience
Handle extra error cases in the App on the Front End as well as back end, such as 404, 500, etc.
Add validations as well
Code Cleanups - The code must be pristine
