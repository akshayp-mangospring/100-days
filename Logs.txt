15 July 2023:
Today I added a Todo List App from scratch without any help and I am proud to have done it all by myself.
Although there are a lot more features I wish to add to the project.
I did the Front End in React and Back End in Rails, SQLite.
I'll do the same project later in NodeJS and MongoDB.

The features I'm gonna add to the App are:
Users & Authentication with JWT
Blog with Comments
Replies on the Comments
Comments must be likeable
Replies on Comments must be likeable
Pomodoro Timer

The full view of the App must be a Productivity App:

Todos
Daily Logger
