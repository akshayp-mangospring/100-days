Today I added a Todo List App from scratch without any help and I am proud to have done it all by myself.
Although there are a lot more features I wish to add to the project.
I did the Front End in React and Back End in Rails, SQLite.

Added MySQL as database for Basic Todos App. Initially the DB was SQLite, but I changed it to MySQL now, so that I can have hands on experience on MySQL itself.
