15 July 2023:
Today I added a Todo List App from scratch without any help and I am proud to have done it all by myself.
Although there are a lot more features I wish to add to the project.
I did the Front End in React and Back End in Rails, SQLite.
I'll do the same project later in NodeJS and MongoDB.

The features I'm gonna add to the App are:
Users & Authentication with JWT
Blog with Comments
Replies on the Comments
Blog must be likeable
Comments must be likeable
Replies on Comments must be likeable
Pomodoro Timer

The full view of the App must be a Productivity App:
The Motto of the App will be to Write within a set time for stuff which should not require more time.
Stuff such as your daily log shouldn't require time more than 5 mins.
If the timer is up then stuff would be Auto Published.
Max time should be 25 mins for anything.
Write a Blog article within a Pomodoro timer set, on Pomodoro finish
Write a Blog article without a Pomodoro timer
Todos
Daily Logger

In future:
Deletion of a Todo should also give an Undo action, but just for 3 seconds, which will give a final call to deletion API.
A Todo should have notes/desc with rich text support, priority, due date.
