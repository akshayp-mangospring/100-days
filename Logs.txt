15 July 2023:
Today I added a Todo List App from scratch without any help and I am proud to have done it all by myself.
Although there are a lot more features I wish to add to the project.
I did the Front End in React and Back End in Rails, SQLite.

19 July 2023:
Today I added mark a Todo as done. The API and the Front End for it as well.
Added a basic Pomodoro Timer on the Front End.

21 July 2023:
Added a basic React Router with basic Components to support User Login in the future.

3 August 2023:
Added MySQL as database for Basic Todos App. Initially the DB was SQLite, but I changed it to MySQL now, so that I can have hands on experience on MySQL itself.

4 August 2023:
Added Basic Sign Up and Login API and Users Model.
Added base for JWT as well, but not fully implemented.

8 August 2023:
Studied about token based authentication.
- Access token
- Refresh token
Also, chalked out flows of Login, Signup and subsequent requests in token based authentication.

10 August 2023:
Implemented functional JWTs
Added Authentication, Authorization in it
Added User based Todos
Integrated the Login and Signup, CRUD of Todos on Front End

13 August 2023:
Create the Todo App with Users in NodeJS and MySQL
- Major shift in psyche, now, I'm not very much fearful of implementing Back End Projects in multiple languages.
- Now, I'm planning to take on large scale projects in Back End by myself. Like a Railway Booking or E-commerce App.
- I'm also ready to set my sights back on DSA.

21 August 2023:
Added support for User based Articles on the Back End
Code cleanups - Used `before_action` filter effectively and thus reduced code repetition
Also checked permissions while performing actions on any Article

24 August 2023:
Integrate CRUD of Blogs on Front End

25 August 2023:
Add Basic Polymorphic Comments on Blog
Integrate CRUD of it on Front End
Add basic profile page
Demoed the basic version of the app to Hitesh

Major Success:
I've finally completed the basic version of A Todo App along with Blog - End to End.
The code is shit and there are many edge cases left out and no error handling has been done whatsoever. But still, I'm satisfied with the progress which I made during the past couple of days.
I am very confident and aware that all the above listed shortcomings can be achieved by me. So, I am not putting up a lot of effort in keeping the codebase pristine or handling all the edge cases or making the best UI/UX possible.
I would rather focus my energies on the new and complex topics which I need to learn in Databases and System Design.
I'm gonna add more features in this app regardless so that it can be deployed and used by people.

26 August 2023:
Add capability to add videos in the App.
Reuse the Comments component between Blogs and Videos.
Add capability to Embed YouTube videos in App.

27 August 2023:
Delete dependent comments of any Video or Blog if it's deleted.
Add the UI of Replies on Comments in the app.
