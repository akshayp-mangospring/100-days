Normalization:
If data integrity is compromised, then we have bad database design.
Redundancy shouldn't be allowed. Database should be a single source of truth.
Normalized data is protected from:
  - Insertion Anomalies
  - Updation Anomalies
  - Deletion Anomalies

Normal Forms in a database are a set of principles to be followed while deisgning a database.

Order of safety in Data:
- First Normal Form - Least Safe
- Second Normal Form
- Third Normal Form
- Fourth Normal Form
- Fifth Normal Form - Most Safe

Normmalization is a safety assessment on a DB. Just like we can have safety levels for a bridge, we can have safety assessment for data in DB.
There's no concept of row ordering in Database queries. So, we need to be as explicit as possible to convey information which is relevant to the database.

The values which goes into a database column should be of a single data type. It shouldn't be a mix of data types.
Every Table should have a primary key no matter what according to First Normal Form.

First Normal Form Rules:
- Using Row order to convey information is not permitted.
- Mixing data types within the same column isn't permitted.
- Having a table without a Primary Key isn't permitted.
- Repeating groups are not permitted.

These should be avoided:
- Deletion Anomaly
- Updation Anomaly
- Insertion Anomaly

Third Normal Form - It's very similar to Boyce Codd Normal Form:
Every Non key attribute in a table should depend on key. the whole key(because a primary key can consist of multiple columns) and nothing but the key.
